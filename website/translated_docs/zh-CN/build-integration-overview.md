Crust can be used in a wide range of scenarios, including:

1. Serverless DApp/website hosting

   Developers are able to deploy their own Dapps/websites based on Crust/IPFS Network. With this, developers are able to only focus on building Dapps/websites, no need for server management. Moreover, Crust Network incentivizes multiple nodes to store Dapp/website files and provide storage services, thus ensuring the high availability of Dapps/websites. [Crust Apps](https://apps.crust.network) is an example, it is hosted on Crust Network.

2. General off-chain data storage

   Some blockchain-based decentralized applications, such as NFT and decentralized social platforms, involve a large amount of user data, far beyond the on-chain storage capacity. Based on Crust/IPFS Network, developers can provide general off-chain data storage services for these applications.

3. Accelerated content delivery

   Developers are able to build P2P content delivery network (CDN) services with Crust/IPFS Network. Crust Network incentivizes the nodes to spontaneously distribute CDN data and play the role of CDN edge nodes to accelerate the data transmission for CDN users.

4. Secured cloud storage
   Developers are able to build Cloud storage applications with Crust/IPFS Network. Without maintaining storage clusters, developers only need to integrate the SDK of Crust/IPFS into applications to provide users with stable storage services.

This section includes detailed guidance on how to integrate Crust into your system for specific use cases.

- [WebSite/DApp frontend hosting](build-integration-website-hosting.md) - includes guidance on how to deploy and host a website on IPFS + Crust.
- [Content storage & delivery](build-integration-content-storage-delivery.md) - developers can follow the guide to build cloud storage, file distribution and even standard S3-like services on Crust.
- [NFT data storage](build-integration-nft-data.md) - includes a solution to store NFT files using IPFS + Crust.

You are welcome to contributes on more use cases and integration solutions.
