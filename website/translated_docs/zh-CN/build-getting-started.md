Welcome to the builders section of the Crust Wiki!

Here you will be able to find the most up-to-date information on the status of the development tools in the Crust ecosystem. We are always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about them so if you are working on something that should be included please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/D97GGQndmx).

## How to Read

**Basic** listed all the development kits which both developer and miner uses. If you want to quickly start, you can just jump this section.

We highly recommended **Developers** started with [Hello Crust](build-hello-crust.md), you'll learn a simple but super fundamental techniques of Crust.

**Miners** please refer the miners guide.
