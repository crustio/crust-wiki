### 7.2 Watch compose

- Command
```shell
sudo crust tools watch-chain
```
Generate a "watch-chain.yaml" configuration file in the current directory, and use docker-compose to start the watcher node

- Instance
Start:
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f watch-chain.yaml up -d
```

Monitor:
```shell
sudo docker logs crust-watch
```

## 8 Configure external source chain
The use of an external chain can make the member node more lightweight, and it can also make multiple members connect to the same watch chain node, thereby avoiding repeated chain synchronization to a certain extent. However, due to the single point of failure in this method, that is to say, the failure of the external source chain node will cause multiple members to fail to report the workload, so please try to use a better network device or cloud server to start the external source chain. At the same time, do not connect too many members to the same chain. It is recommended to have less than 10 members, otherwise the workload may not be reported due to congested transactions.

### 8.1 Configure watch chain service

a Machine selection

The requirements of the Watch machine are as follows:
- The machine running the watch does not require SGX
- 500GB solid state drive
- It is recommended to use a stable network with public IP and fixed ports, which will directly affect the workload report of member nodes
- Install Crust node
- Recommend cloud server

b Generate docker compose file

```shell
sudo crust tools watch-chain
```

Generate a "watch-chain.yaml" configuration file in the current directory

c Start watch chain

Start:
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f watch-chain.yaml up -d
```

Monitor:
```shell
sudo docker logs crust-watch
```

d Matters needing attention

- You can edit the "watch-chain.yaml" file to customize the watcher node
- The watcher node can provide ws and rpc services, the default port is 30888, 19933, 19944, pay attention to open ports

### 8.2 Member node use external source chain

Set up to connect to other chains,default is "ws://127.0.0.1:19944"

- Command
```shell
sudo crust config conn-chain {ws}
```
- Instance

Set up a chain connected to "ws://7.7.7.7:19944"

```shell
sudo crust config conn-chain ws://7.7.7.7:19944
```
![start](assets/node/connchain.png)

**If it is a node that is already running, the node needs to be restarted for the configuration of the external source chain to take effect**

## 9 Control SGX driver automatic installation

- Disable automatic installation of SGX driver

Execute the following commands before starting the node:
```shell
sudo mv /opt/crust/crust-node/scripts/install_sgx_driver.sh /opt/crust/crust-node/scripts/install_sgx_driveroff.sh
```
- Enable automatic installation of SGX driver

Execute the following commands before starting the node:

```shell
sudo mv /opt/crust/crust-node/scripts/install_sgx_driveroff.sh /opt/crust/crust-node/scripts/install_sgx_driver.sh
```
