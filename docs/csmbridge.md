***Step 2.*** Enter the Crust Shadow receiving account(*start with `cT`*) in frame 2; enter the amount that you want to transfer in frame 3; click “Transfer” after you confirm there is no mistake above, then sign and complete the transaction.

> **NOTE** The sending account on Maxwell-side needs some CRUs as blockchain transaction fee.
