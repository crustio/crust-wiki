The Crust Ecosystem Growth Program is designed to provide technical, business and financial support for Crust ecology applications. We welcome all projects currently using or planning to use Crust to [register for the Crust Ecosystem Growth Program](https://airtable.com/shrS6lp8H8q7NsIiF). Once your projects have passed our review, they will receive support from the Crust ecosystem in the following three ways:

1. Technical Support

  For projects in the Crust Ecosystem Growth Program, our technical staff will provide answers/solutions to difficulties met by developers as soon as possible through Discord, and provide all the required development documentations.
  
  After the Crust ecosystem team review, **a discord group** will be created. The project developer will get technical support from this discord group.

2. Marketing collaboration

  The projects in Crust Ecosystem Growth Program are able to be jointly promoted with Crust, and the promotion channels mainly include: co-hosting AMA, joint PR Announcement, and forwarding and promotion.

  After the Crust ecosystem team review, **a discord group** will be created. The Crust marketing team will conduct market cooperation in the group

3. Investment resources

  If needed, Crust can help match projects in Crust Ecosystem Growth Program with external investment institutions. The investment institusions include but are not limited to: DFG, NGC ventrues, and IOSG.

## Process of Crust Ecosystem Growth Program

### Step 1, Projects submitting registration form

Project applicants fill out and submit registration forms on the Crust Ecosystem Project [registration page](https://airtable.com/shrS6lp8H8q7NsIiF).

### Step 2, Crust Ecosystem team reviewing registration form

### Step 3, Notifying results by email within 7 working days

Case 1: if the application is successful, the Crust Ecosystem team will contact project coordinators via email to obtain more information such as Telegram or Discord to get ready for more in-depth collaboration.

Case 2: if some information needed in the application form is missing, the Crust Ecosystem team will contact project coordinators to ask for the information needed.

Case 3: if the project submitted for registration is not compatible with the development of the Crust Network ecology, the Crust Ecosystem team will also inform that by email.

### Step 4, If the registration is successful

If the registration is successful, all later-on collaboration and support will be coordinated through Telegram or Discord.

We encourage all ecology projects to publish high-quality technical articles on such channels as Medium. These projects will have the chance to be listed on the Crust website and the Crust Ecosystem Page, and the Crust marketing team will also increase efforts to promote these projects as appropriate.
