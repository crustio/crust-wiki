Crust provides standard file upload and download services based on the combination of IPFS. Developers can build cloud storage functions, file distribution and even standard S3-like services on Crust.
There are 2 ways to store file using `Node.js`:

- [With IPFS](build-file-storing-demo.md)
- [Without IPFS (with IPFS gateway)](build-file-storing-gw-demo.md)
