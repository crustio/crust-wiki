The Crust Network has built a [Decentralized Storage Market (DSM)](DSM.md) that allows everyone to access it. Storage users and merchants both can take what they need from the DSM.

## Storage Users

Storage users are those who have storage needs. They can initiate storage orders in the DSM by paying a certain fee. Storage fees are dynamically adjusted depending on the storage resources in the network, on-chain state resources, and throughput resources, and users can also add a small fee to expedite the handling process of storage orders. Check out the [Storage User Guide](storageUserGuide.md) for more details.

Storage users can also get **storage order discounts** by locking CRUs in storage market collateral. Check [Storage Market Benefits](marketBenefits.md) for more details.

## Storage Merchants

[Group Owner nodes](ownerNode.md) can register as storage merchants on behalf of the Group and are required to pay a certain deposit for doing so. The storage merchants receive storage orders through the DSM, and the Member nodes in the Group will be responsible for completing file storage and providing retrieval services.

Merchants will be rewarded with the following benefits after successfully storing files:

1. a corresponding storage income from the DSM.

2. an extended effective data. (The effective data will contribute more stake limit than SRD), which can effectively increase the stake limit of nodes and in turn help the nodes get higher staking rewards.*The specific rules for the stake limit calculation can be found in the [Economic White Paper](https://ipfs-hk.decoo.io/ipfs/QmRYJN6V5BzwnXp7A2Avcp5WXkgzyunQwqP3Es2Q789phF).*

Check out the [Storage Merchant Guide](merchantGuidance.md) for more details of being a storage merchant.

## Developers

The Crust Network has provided necessary technical tools for developers to enable them to build DSM-based applications needed in varied business scenarios. Check out [how to build](build-getting-started.md).
