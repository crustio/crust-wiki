For the introduction of the role of the guarantor, please refer to [guarantor](guarantor.md). This article mainly introduces how the guarantor can participate in GPoS and get rewards.

## Bond Accounts
Makesure you have finished [account setup steps](new-bond.md), and bonded your stash and controller account.

## Explorer Validators
* Click “Staking” in the top and click “Overview” or "Waiting"
* Choose a validator and click it's icon in the validator list to copy the validator's Account ID.

> If a validator obtains 1000 CRU staking reward in one era, and if his own self-staking is 90% of the total staking amount of him (the other 10% is the guarantor's staking). If the guarantee fee set by the validator is 30%, the final guarantor will receive a total of 1000 * 10% * 30% = 30 CRUs, and the validator will get 970 CRUs.

## Effective Stake

For example:

There is a validator who obtained a Stake Limit of 100 CRUs by providing storage, this Validator also have 100 CRUs bonded, then all the 100 CRUs will be all effective staked to the validator.

At this time, if a guarantor guarantees the same validator, the guarantee amount is 400 CRUs. After waiting for an ERA, the effective stake contributed by the guarantor and validator are 80 and 20 CRUs respectively. That is, each part's effective stake are calculated from their contributions according to the proportion of the guaranteed CRU.
