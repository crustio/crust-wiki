### Effective Stake

For example:

There is a validator who obtained a Stake Limit of 100 CRUs by providing storage, this Validator also have 100 CRUs bonded, then all the 100 CRUs will be all effective staked to the validator.

At this time, if a guarantor guarantees the same validator, the guarantee amount is 400 CRUs. After waiting for an ERA, the effective stake contributed by the guarantor and validator are 80 and 20 CRUs respectively. That is, each part's effective stake are calculated from their contributions according to the proportion of the guaranteed CRU.
