This doc will walk you through a typical process to save and publish a simple website in Crust Network, to help you understand the basic steps to use Crust before you write any code. In this tutorial, we will build a simple React website, put to IPFS, and leverage Crust to store and pin it. The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building with Crust Storage, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of Crust storage functions.

## Hello, Crust

### 1. Setup Crust CLI

> Please make sure you have **Node.js** env, refer to [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install.

- Install Crust Command Line

```shell
sudo npm i -g @crustio/crust-cli
```

- Create a React app

```shell
npx create-react-app hello-crust
```

- Build it

```shell
cd hello-crust/
PUBLIC_URL=./ npm run build
```

### 2. Store, Pin and Publish

> Please make sure you have **IPFS** running locally, refer to [this](https://ipfs.io/#install) to install and run.

- Login with seeds

> *SEEDS* are 12 secret words of your Crust Account. You can refer to [this](crust-account.md) to create your Crust Account.

```shell
crust-cli login [SEEDS]
```

- Pin `build/`

```shell
crust-cli pin build/
```

You'll get an IPFS cid in this step, like `QmYene5icko1cusFCG9D92YUyfonN4hmRPNdPkxvJkNjTb`.

- Publish `build/`

```shell
crust-cli publish QmYene5icko1cusFCG9D92YUyfonN4hmRPNdPkxvJkNjTb
```

Now your website is published into Crust Network. Storage nodes in Crust Network will get notified and try to pull your website to store.

### 3. Query status

After you publish your website, you can run this command to monitor if your website is picked by any storage nodes

```shell
crust-cli status QmYene5icko1cusFCG9D92YUyfonN4hmRPNdPkxvJkNjTb
```

```shell
âœ… QmYene5icko1cusFCG9D92YUyfonN4hmRPNdPkxvJkNjTb picked, replicas: 24
```

### 4. Access it

**Congrats**, you can now access your website via any standard IPFS interface and gateway, such as following public IPFS gateway that Crust contributes:
