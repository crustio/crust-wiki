## 4. Set Guarantee Fee

The guarantee fee set by the validator refers to the percentage of the staking rewards distributed to his guarantors. 


> For example, if the validator obtains 1000 CRU staking rewards in one era, and if his self-staking accounts for 90% of his total staking(The remaining 10% is contributed by guarantors). If the guarantee fee is 95%, then the guarantors finally obtains 1000 * 10% * 95% = 95 CRUs income, and the remaining 5 CRU belongs to the validator.
