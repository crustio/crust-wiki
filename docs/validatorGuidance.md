The validator is the basic unit of the Crust Network. Refer to this document to become a validator of Crust Network.

### Preparation

You need to ensure that you have enough CRUs for sending transactions. You can claim your CRU from Ethereum [Claim to Maxwell](claims.md).

### Bond Accounts
Make sure you have completed [Account Configuration](new-bond.md), and have bonded your stash and controller accounts.

### Setup Crust Nodes

Refer to [Node Overview](node-overview.md) to setup your nodes.

You can change your self-staked token amount in [APPS](apps.crust.network).
