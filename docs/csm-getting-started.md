## What is Crust Shadow

Crust Shadow is a "Kusama version" for Crust Network, an early unaudited release of the code that is available first and holds real economic value.

Crust Shadow is designed to be a Kusama parachain. It has won the 57th Kusama slot.

Crust Shadow is a proving ground for XCMP, can provide storage function to other parachains. it will be upgraded following the Kusama’s development.


## How to Use Crust Shadow

At the early stage, Crust Shadow starts with a PoA consensus, in order to be compatible with Kusama parachain. You can develop cross-chain message mode or use cross-chain message passing service on it. Crust Shadow is a storage-functional network, storage orders that come from the relay chain will be passed to Crust Maxwell’s storage market.

In the future stage, Crust Shadow will be upgraded to provide the full functions based on Kusama’s parachain development process.
