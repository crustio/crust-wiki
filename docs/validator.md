## Validator

The validator is the node that verifies transactions and generates blocks in Crust network, and maintains the security of the entire blockchain network. In [GPoS](GPoS.md) (Guranteed Proof of Stake) consensus of Crust network, in addition to staying online, validators also need to provide storage services and stake a certain number of CRU tokens.

### Validator Rewards and Penalties

Validators participating in the network can obtain rewards for generating blocks and also obtain rewards for staking.


Validators are important for maintaining the network. Slashing will happen if a validator misbehaves (e.g. goes offline, attacks the network, or runs modified software) in the network. They and their [guarantors](guarantor.md) will get slashed by losing a percentage of their bonded/staked CRUs. 



As a storage merchant, a validator can also provide storage services to earn storage fees in Crust decentralized storage market.

### How to become a validator

To become a validator you need to prepare storage resources, a high-quality network, and deploy your nodes. See the node deployment guides:[Isolation Node](isolationNode.md)、[Group Owner](ownerNode.md)、[Group Member](memberNode.md)
