## Overview

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a way to prove ownership of digital art and collectibles.
NFT assets, like artworks and collectibles which come to public eyes through multimedia files such as images and videos, are relatively expensive if stored on the blockchain and therefore need to be stored off-chain.
[SwitchSwap](https://switchswap.io/#/home) is an [open sourced](https://github.com/switchswapbox/switchswap-nft) decentralized NFT minting platform based on IPFS, Crust and Polygon chain.

**Note**

1. This article uses the NFT exchange as an example to illustrate the process of integrating Crust/IPFS network.
2. The term "NFT files" is used to mean the multimedia files of NFT assets in this article.

## Overview process

The NFT trading platform serves the storage needs of NFT files by integrating Crust and IPFS. The entire solution can be divided into four steps:

1. Import NFT files into IPFS;
2. Store and distribute NFT files through Crust Network;
3. Monitor the storage status of NFT files in Crust Network;
4. Users access NFT files in the NFT trading platform;
5. Add money to auto-extend expired time of your NFT file.

## Detailed process

### 1. Import NFT files into IPFS

Import NFT files into IPFS by Crust IPFS Gateway when NFT is generated

- Choose an [IPFS W3Auth Gateways](https://github.com/crustio/crust-apps/blob/master/packages/apps-config/src/ipfs-gateway-endpoints/index.ts)

- Use the following default Web3 Auth Header or create your own Web3 Auth Header by refering this doc:[Get a Basic Authentication header](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSWeb3AuthGW#usage)

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://gw.crustfiles.app/api/v0/add?pin=true' --header 'Authorization: Basic c3Vic3RyYXRlLWNUTWo5NnlLUWZzM20yeWVZQjVQcGl6Sld5UFV1UkRmZnRNN2dnNkFMRG5xUjViSEs6MHhlNDU0NmM5Y2MwOWViODdiYzNkNGNjODcyMjk0YzA5MTAwNmMzZGJlYTI3ZTM0MWU3ZDc0Yzk3MjVhMGE1MzQ0NTM5ZDVkZGMwZDgxZGI5YWU3MDg4OTE0MTljNWFiM2NiM2YxYWNkYWQwMTk4MDc2MzVjNmU2ZTQzNmU4Njg4OQ==' --form 'file=@"/home/crust/FireCloud.png"'
```

Any file imported into IPFS gateway will be given a unique CID (anyone can retrieve the file on IPFS Network by this CID).


```json
{
    "Name": "FireCloud.png",
    "Hash": "QmbLmgLUR1VZNpttojd752fyng8Bz3ZbPqabQ76MVLXT7P",
    "Size": "2247325"
}
```

From the returned value, we can find the CID is: `QmbLmgLUR1VZNpttojd752fyng8Bz3ZbPqabQ76MVLXT7P`

### 2. Store and distribute NFT files via Crust Network

Once NFT files are uploaded into IPFS Network, we need the Crust Network nodes to pin the files and provide retrieval services so that the files are always accessible, .

#### 2.1 Install dependencies

The NFT trading platform installs dependencies pertaining to Crust.
- [@crustio/type-definitions](https://github.com/crustio/crust.js) customized types of data pertaining to Crust Network
- [@polkadot/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api)  promise-style interface provided by the polkadot api library for performing related actions on Crust chain

#### 2.2 Initialize API instance

The NFT trading platform initializes the `api`  instance on the server side so that it can interact with Crust Network. 

```typescript
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';
import { typesBundleForPolkadot, crustTypes } from '@crustio/type-definitions';

// WS address of Crust chain
const chain_ws_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:9933";

// Connect to chain
const api = new ApiPromise({
    provider: new WsProvider(chain_ws_url),
    typesBundle: typesBundleForPolkadot,
});
```

#### 2.3 Set on-chain identity

The NFT trading platform needs to obtain  `KeyringPair` on the chain to be able to send order transactions. It can be generated from the seed files of an account:

```typescript
/* eslint-disable node/no-extraneous-import */
import {Keyring} from '@polkadot/keyring';
import {KeyringPair} from '@polkadot/keyring/types';

// Seeds of account
const seeds = "echo xxxx soccer xxxx catch xxxx stone xxxx pumpkin nest merge xxxx";

const kr = new Keyring({
    type: 'sr25519',
});

// krp will be used in sending transaction
const krp = kr.addFromUri(seeds);
```

#### 2.4 Initiate a storage order on Crust Network

The NFT trading platform initiates a storage order by integrating the following code, where `fileSize` is the "Size" obtained from step 3.1.

```typescript
/**
 * Place storage order
 * @param api chain instance
 * @param fileCID the cid of file
 * @param fileSize the size of file in ipfs
 * @param tip tip for this order
 * @return true/false
 */
async function placeOrder(api: ApiPromise, krp: KeyringPair, fileCID: string, fileSize: number, tip: number) {
    // Determine whether to connect to the chain
    await api.isReadyOrError;
    // Generate transaction
    const pso = api.tx.market.placeStorageOrder(fileCID, fileSize, tip);
    // Send transaction, for 'sendTx()' please refer https://github.com/crustio/crust-demo/blob/main/sample-store-demo/src/utils.ts
    const txRes = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify((await sendTx(krp, pso))));
    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(txRes));
}
```

#### 2.5 Crust storage file

A large number of nodes in the Crust network will obtain the corresponding NFT file through the IPFS network after monitoring the storage order, ensuring high availability and high download speed of the file.

### 3. Monitor the storage status of NFT files in Crust Network

NFT trading platform queries the storage status information of corresponding NFT files by integrating the following code.

```typescript
/**
 * Get on-chain order information about files
 * @param api chain instance
 * @param cid the cid of file
 * @return order state
 */
async function getOrderState(api: ApiPromise, cid: string) {
    await api.isReadyOrError;
    return await api.query.market.filesV2(cid);
}
```

The results of an instance query are shown below:

```
{
    file_size: 23,710,
    spower: 24,895,
    expired_at: 2,594,488,
    calculated_at: 2,488,
    amount: 545.3730 nCRU,
    prepaid: 0,
    reported_replica_count: 1,
    remaining_paid_count: 3,
    replicas: {
        cTHATJrSgZM2haKfn5e47NSP5Y5sqSCCToxrShtVifD2Nfxv5: {
            who: cTHATJrSgZM2haKfn5e47NSP5Y5sqSCCToxrShtVifD2Nfxv5,
            valid_at: 2,140,
            anchor: 0xd9aa29dda8ade9718b38681adaf6f84126531246b40a56c02eff8950bb9a78b7c459721ce976c5c0c9cd4c743cae107e25adc3a85ed7f401c8dde509d96dcba0,
            is_reported: true,
            created_at: 2,140
        }
    }

}
```

where the value of `reported_replica_count` is the number of nodes that store the NFT file: `FireCloud.png` in Crust Network, and the value of `expired_on` is the expired block height of this file order.

*In addition to accessing Crust Network through code, you can also monitor the file storage status through [Crust Apps](https://apps.crust.network/#/storage/market)ï¼š*

### 4. NFT file retrieval and access

The NFT trading platform provides [IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-types) services, and it also integrates [Public IPFS Gateway](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) services so that each NFT file can be accessed through a link that contains CID information. The front-end of the NFT trading platform builds on these links to present to users the multimedia information of the NFT.

For example, the NFT file: `Firecloud.png` can be accessed through [IPFS Scan](https://ipfs-scan.io/)

![pic](assets/build/scan1.png)


```url
https://gw.crustfiles.app/ipfs/QmbLmgLUR1VZNpttojd752fyng8Bz3ZbPqabQ76MVLXT7P
```

![pic](assets/build/ipfsio-nft.png)

If the user has IPFS installed and started locally, access to the same NFT file url will be directly through the local IPFS for the file retrieval.

```url
http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmbLmgLUR1VZNpttojd752fyng8Bz3ZbPqabQ76MVLXT7P
```

![pic](https://crust-data.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/wiki/build/local.png)

Since a large number of nodes in Crust Network have stored the file, the user running IPFS locally can achieve multi-point accelerating effect when accessing the NFT file.

### 5. Add money to your NFT file

Crust's storage market is order-based, once you place a storage order, you'll get 6 month storage duration by default. But each order can be added money to extend the storage time, user can call `add_prepaid` on chain to extend the file order. With this design, **users can decide how long to store their NFT renewal, so that on the one hand, they can make reasonable use of the storage resources of the entire network (the storage of every storage network has a hard limit), and users can freely measure the value of assets to determine the storage duration**. User can easily calculate the prepaid price:

```
storage_time = each_order_amount * 6 month
```

And the following code can help easily call `on-chain` interface to add prepaid money.

```js
/**
 * Add prepaid to an order
 * @param api chain instance
 * @param cid the cid of file
 * @param amount adding money to prepaid
 * @return send transaction true/false
 */
async function addPrepaid(api: ApiPromise, cid: string, amount: number) {
    await api.isReadyOrError;
    // Generate transaction
    const ap = api.tx.market.addPrepaid(cid, amount);
    // Send transaction
    const txRes = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify((await sendTx(krp, ap))));
    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(txRes));
}
```
