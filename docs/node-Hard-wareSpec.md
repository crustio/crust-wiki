Note: For storage nodes in single-node and multi-node form, the CPU needs to support SGX:

* Before starting, please use the following methods to detect whether your CPU supports SGX.
  * Script Detection: https://github.com/crustio/crust/wiki/Check-TEE-supportive
  * Official Website Detection: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html
* Some motherboards only support SGX's software enabled method, please refer to this link: https://github.com/intel/sgx-software-enable
* The BIOS of some motherboards does not have an option to enable SGX, please confirm before purchasing or configuring.

## Group Node Spec

Group consists of a group owner and multiple group members.

### Owner Node

| ** | **CPU** | **Motherboard** | **RAM** | **HDD** | **Network** | **OS** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Require ments | 1.Eight cores or above; 2.Clock speed higher than 3Ghz | \ | >= 32G | Due to  the continuius growth of chain data, it is recommended to use a 1TB or highter capacity SSD | 1.Bandwidth >= 100M; 2.It is recommended to use a network with public IP and fixed ports, otherwise it may cause unnecessary losses due to network fluctuations | Ubuntu |
