![Overall](assets/claims/overview.jpeg)

## Preparation

In order to prevent unknown errors in the claim process, we highly recommend using the following tools to help you in the entire claim process

> Don't worry about being unfamiliar with the following tools, we will teach you how to use them step by step in the following steps.

1. [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/access)
2. [ImToken](https://token.im/) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
3. [Crust Apps](https://apps.crust.network/)

## Steps

### ‚ùóÔ∏è All exchange accounts are invalid

**DO NOT** do the following steps with the exchange account, <font color='red'> that will make the claim invalid and cause asset loss</font>

### I. Burn ERC20 CRU

First of all, PLEASE **MAKE SURE you have read** the following precautions before you burn ERC20 CRU, once you burnt your CRU, nobody can get your asset back:

> 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure your burn is ERC20 CRU, not ETH or other ERC20 tokens
> 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure you **have the authority to make signature** of the ethereum account (you own this account's private key, and again all accounts created by exchanges are NOT APPLICABLE)
> 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure that your each burn transaction is **less than 50,000 CRU**
> 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è ERC20 CRU: [CRUST](https://etherscan.io/token/0x32a7C02e79c4ea1008dD6564b35F131428673c41)
> 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Burn Address: [0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001)

Then, you can burn your ERC20 CRU now üòÑ

1. Go to the claim page in [Crust Apps](https://apps.crust.network/#/claims), transfer your ERC20 CRU to the Burn Address ([0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001)) **in the ethereum network**, you can send this transaction with any kind of ethereum wallets (AGAIN, make sure you own the private key)
![Apps Claim0-0](assets/claims/apps_claims0-0.jpg)
2. Please confirm your transaction is:
   - Successful
   - Has **at least 6 confirmations**
   - **Copy the transaction hash value**
![Apps Claim0-1](assets/claims/apps_claims0-1.jpg)

### II. Verify transaction

Go to the claim page in [Crust Apps](https://apps.crust.network/#/claims)

1. Select the account of Crust mainnet that you want to claim,If you haven't created an account yet, you can refer to this [create account tutorial](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/crustAccount#create-accout)
2. Paste the transaction hash value you copied in [Step I](#i-burn-erc20-cru)
3. Make sure your transaction's **amount <= claim limit**
4. Click "Continue", this step will wait for a while, the claim service will check the legicimacy of your transaction.

![Apps Claims2](assets/claims/apps_claims2.png)

If a red error appears in the upper right corner of the page, it means you have failed in this step, it may caused by the following reasons:

1. Your transaction's confirmations is not enough (**at least 6 confirmations**)
2. Your transaction amount exceeding the claim limit, if so, please wait it to recover
3. Claim service may busy for a while, if that, you can wait and try it later

### III. Log in to MyEtherWallet and Connect to your wallet

> Since MyEtherWallet supports lots of wallets, the following process will use 'ImToken' and 'MetaMask' as example, other wallets are super familiar with these 2

**‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure that the connecting wallet address is same as the address where the transaction was successfully sent in [Step I](#i-burn-erc20-cru)** (We need to sign the message with the private key of this address)

**If you're using ImToken mobile wallet**

1. Open [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/access):
    - Click 'Mobile Apps'
    - Connect the wallet address which you **burnt the ERC20 CRU**
